This is a dataset used to detect whether a patient has breast cancer depending on the following features:

- diagnosis: (label) the diagnosis of breast (label) tissues (M = malignant, B = benign).
- radius: distances from center to points on the perimeter.
- texture: standard deviation of gray-scale values.
- perimeter: perimeter of the tumor.
- area: area of the tumor.
- smoothness: local variation in radius lengths.
- compactness: is equal to (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0).
- concavity: severity of concave portions of the contour.
- concave points: number of concave portions of the contour.
- symmetry: symmetry of the tumor shape.
- fractal dimension: "coastline approximation" - 1.
